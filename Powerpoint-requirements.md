# In our presentation (will be 10 minutes per group and it will be a PowerPoint):
- TBC – table of contents (with documentation of everything in the presentation)
- Introduction
- Requirements (what the customer actually asked for)
- Analysis of the requirements (here’s what we found out about the requirements, we have to say what we think the client is looking for. In this analysis we also have to do line of code analysis, so how much lines of code we think we'll write, how long we think all the developers will spend on it, hourly rate, total cost)
- Design with deliverables and milestones – bullet format to verbally describe what we will be coding and how we will be doing it and explain what the randomization is doing
- Implementation with the target software product in the chosen implementation language(s) with possible version of the language being used and 3rd person libraries being used (so how we will code this, what platform, what language, what libraries, etc. Look at pg. 262 for more ideas and can possibly do a flow chart or diagram)
- Testing – wants the testing strategy, the testing plan which will tell what we are testing and how we are testing it
- Post delivery maintenance – he wants us to give a post delivery plan for the software to be maintained
- Demonstration – demo of prototyped code
