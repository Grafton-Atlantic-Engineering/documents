convert from flat file (stream) it

account #, fitrst last name birthday address city state date and age 


given a csv file, process the data & get a 24 digit randomized hash
part of a production program

not verifiable 

the generator works on accounts 

24 digits gets carried through the session

txid goes back to web server to awssociate a session on a server with the user

this is for everything, 

no collisions 

session gets a txid 

he didnt specify a numeric base

classname can be arbitrary
needs to havea defined method function 
define method function to return said number

highest objective - doesnt crash, no information is exposed 

can recover from empty data stream

doesnt know if he wants a user id 
* design with intention of the data being completely arbitrary

will be part of a tomcat server

no need to pull a past ID out of a database

wants it to be one-way 

he wants comments

one txid per user 

want to be able to track both the session id and the transaction id 

we can have it be alphanumeric 

data stream will be posted 

will need a person class that will have info about themselves 
- fnmae lname zip code city break depending on the name we get 
normalize the file get data group into 3NF

there will be nulls, but probably in the places that matters
