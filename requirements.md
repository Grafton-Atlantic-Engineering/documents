# Requirements List

- We need to create a random generator to produce a random 24 character alpha numeric transaction number (there should be no special characters, only numbers and letters) -> this must be true randomness and not pseudo random
- We will be getting our data from a CSV file which will be comprised of an account number (alpha numeric), first name, last name, street, state, zip code, company
- All we need from the program is the CSV file to create a transaction ID for each user each time they log in
- The program will be integrated into our client's current system that handles the 10 character transaction ID generator and it will replace the 10 character transaction ID generator
- The current transaction ID generator is being replaced because is not creating a truly random transaction number and it is only creating a 10 digit transaction ID but the client now wants 24
- This program will replace the functionality of the 10 digit one (this will be a class with a name that he gives us that will have a method)
- This will be truly randomized
- The language our program should be in is Java
- The transaction ID will not be stored in a database or file, it will be generated each time the user logs in
- The goal of our transaction ID program is so the customers will be better served because it will be a truly randomized transaction ID so their personal information will be protected
- This program won’t be used by a user necessarily, it will be put into production program
- This randomized number will be with the customer in a window session throughout the entire time they are logged in
-	The transaction ID will be for web transactions, ATMs, etc. 
-	Each transaction ID must be unique – each time a customer logs in, they get a unique ID that carries through the session
- The highest objective of the program is to not crash – need to make sure that if there is data in the data stream that is incorrect the program recovers from it and still creates a transaction ID
- It will be part of a complete application that runs off of tomcat, maybe part of the servlet
-	There is no encryption standard
-	Run time – the client wants the program to be as fast as possible
-	There will be about 15-115 users per second
-	The code needs to be commented so the client's team knows what each part of our program does
-	Session ID will be part of the structure and the transaction ID will be associated with it – won’t be a part of the session ID but will be associated with it
-	Once the user logs in they will be assigned this transaction ID
-	The transaction ID will take both upper and lower case as well as digits 0-9, no special characters
-	Null is invalid for input, we won’t have to deal with bad data except for nulls
-	There are customers all over the world
-	We can use any pre-existing libraries
-	We don’t have to worry about data hiding
-	We don’t have to worry about it being a duplicate of it being a previously random generated number
-	Get rid of the transaction ID after user logs out
-	Wants it in a class form – instantiate an object and it will be imbedded in an already existing program
-	Wants logging capability – needs to log the row, the number of iterations that the loop did to the console (System.out)
-	Errors will be in a try/catch block and the exception should be printed to the console
-	Not requiring unit testing but would be good to add
